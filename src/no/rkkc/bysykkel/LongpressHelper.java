/**
 * The MapActivity does not seem to include support for longpresses, and this class is intended to
 * facilitate that functionality. It is intended to be instantiated in the activity and called from
 * MapActivity.dispatchTouchEvent().
 * 
 * Here's how it can be used for this purpose:
 * 
 * 1) Override MapActivity.dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent event).
 * 	  This allows us to intercept all touch events.
 * 2) In dispatchTouchEvent(), call LongpressHelper.handleMotionEvent() for every event action
 *    except MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN. This call makes sure to reset the longpress state in this class if any
 *    motion occurs that is invalid for a longpress.
 * 3) In dispatchTouchEvent(), create a new thread for all events of the type
 *    MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN, and call LongpressHelper.isLongPressedDetected() from this thread.
 *    Check the result, and if this is true, a longpress is detected and you can act accordingly.
